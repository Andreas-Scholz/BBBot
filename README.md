# BBBot

An Android app that plays [Block Blast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.block.juggle)
on its own and tries to reach the highest score it can.

BBBot sits on top of the game: it looks at the screen, works out the board and the three
pieces on offer, decides where they should go and drags them there.

## How it works

```
screenshot ──► recognition ──► solver ──► gestures
    ▲                                        │
    └────────────── next turn ◄──────────────┘
```

- **Screen access and control** go through an Android `AccessibilityService`. It can take
  screenshots, dispatch drag gestures and show a small overlay with a start/stop button on
  top of the game. No root and no PC connection are needed.
- **Recognition** turns a screenshot into the 8×8 board and the pieces in the tray.
- **The solver** tries every order and position for the pieces on offer and rates the
  resulting boards.
- **Every turn starts from a fresh screenshot**, so the bot never relies on what it thinks
  the board should look like.

## The solver

The board is a 64-bit number, one bit per cell, so placing a piece and finding full rows and
columns are a handful of bit operations. For the pieces on offer the solver walks through
every order and every position (at most 6 · 64³ sequences) and rates the board each sequence
ends with:

- empty cells are good,
- edges between filled and empty cells are bad, which keeps the board compact,
- single empty cells enclosed on three or four sides are bad,
- room for a 3×3 square and for lines of five is good, because those are the pieces that end
  games,
- cleared rows and columns give a small bonus on top.

If the pieces cannot all be placed, the solver places as many as it can.

The weights were tuned by letting the solver play simulated games against uniformly drawn
pieces (`Simulator` in the unit tests). The real game draws its pieces differently, so those
games only rank settings against each other.

## Building

Requirements: JDK 17 or newer and the Android SDK (path in `local.properties` as `sdk.dir`).

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug        # APK: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest    # JVM unit tests
```

## Development

Every feature is developed on its own branch and merged into `main` when it is finished.
